              I woke up this morning, <br />and a wonderful idea came to my
              mind.
              <br />
              I felt like I was in a cartoon, and like a light bulbðŸ’¡went on
              above my head.
              <br /><br />
              <b>What do I mean?</b>
              <brr /><br />
              From my point of view, I felt that the 2 job interviews we had
              were successful. And I thought to emphasize a certain aspect of me
              that was less prominent in the interviews - the affinity for
              games.
              <br /><br />
              So in case you are wondering about my candidacy, I decided to
              quickly build 2 very simple games, just for fun and send it to
              you.

              and let's start playing! <br /><br />
              ðŸŽ® 1st Note: I am going to meet this week a good friend of mine
              who is a super duper gamer, and he is going to teach me everything
              about gaming (well, we can call it homework, fortunately I really
              love to learn new things ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜…).
              <br /><br />
              ðŸŽ® 2nd Note: How lucky I am that 3 years ago, when this photo was
              taken, I chose to wear these socks that fit our situation
              perfectly, right?
              <br />(well, synchronization appears in real life too, not just in
              code). <br /><br />
              ðŸŽ® 3rd Note: These 2 games are very simple games, I have the
              ability to produce much cooler and much more complex things.

                This is a gambling game between 2 players.<br/><br/>
                The inspiration for this game I got from a Udemy course, so a lot of credit goes to Jonas Schmedtmann.<br/><br/>
                <b>How to Win?</b><br/>
                The first player that reach 100 points - wins!<br/><br/>
                <b>The Rules:</b><br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ Each player on his turn rolls a dice.<br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ Every time a player rolls a dice, the number received on the dice is accumulated.<br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ The player can roll a dice as many times as he wants in a row.<br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ If the player got the number 1, HO NO! the player loses all his points.<br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ If the player wants to keep his points - he clicks "Hold" and the second player gets to play his turn.<br/>
                ðŸ‘‰ Game ends with the first player reach 100 points.

                This game shows the spiritual side of our life.<br/><br/>
                Gaur Gopal Das is an Indian monk associated with ISKCON - the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.<br/><br/>
                This game based on one of the basic principles of Gopal Das, the principle that says that no matter what happens in life - there is no need to worry.<br/><br/>

                <b>So... do you have a problem in life?</b><br/><br/>
                Come find the solution to that in this game.<br/><br/>
                I got inspiration for this game from Gaur Gopal Das.<br/><br/>
